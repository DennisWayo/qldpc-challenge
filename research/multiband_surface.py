"""Multi-band dense-packed surface codes: the general (rows, m, pitch) family.

`research/build_dense_surface.py` reconstructs one point of this family -- the
published two-band, three-patch packing of arXiv:2511.06758 (Fujiu et al.),
which is the board's [[101,5,5]]. Its site mask hard-codes that configuration.
This module states the same mask as a rule over an arbitrary number of bands
and patches, following the description in
`fieldnotes/2026-09-01-multiband-dense-packing-method.md` section 1.

Geometry. Square surface-code patches are laid out in horizontal *bands*:

    even bands  r = 0, 2, ...   m     patches at x = j * Px,  Px = 2d + 2
    odd  bands  r = 1, 3, ...   m - 1 patches at x = (d + 1) + j * Px
    band r starts at  y0 = r * pitch

The half-pitch stagger of the odd bands is what lets neighbouring patches share
boundary infrastructure, so the packing is one connected code rather than a
direct sum of patches. Each patch contributes three kinds of occupied site:

    window interior         (x+y) % 2 == 0      inside the 2d-1 square
    vertical edge columns   (x+y) % 4 == ph     at x = x0 and x = x0 + 2d
    horizontal edge rows    (x+y) % 4 == 2 - ph at y = y0 and y = y0 + 2d

with the band phase ph = 0 on even bands and 2 on odd ones. Qubit conventions
are the published ones: data on odd/odd sites, (x+y) % 4 == 2 ancillas carry
X-checks and the rest Z-checks, each check supporting the diagonal data
neighbours present in the mask.

The closed form k = rows*m - rows//2 is NOT trusted here: `params()` recomputes
k by exact GF(2) rank, the discipline the fieldnote's section 6 records paying
for. `pitch` likewise is a free parameter to be measured, not assumed.

Band pitch, read off the board rather than assumed. Matching this builder
against every single-layer weight-4 board entry reproduces 58 of them exactly,
and their pitches fall into two regimes:

    rows == 2   pitch = d - 1          the published two-band packing
    rows >= 3   pitch = 2 * (3*d//4)   the fieldnote's measured pitch_min(d)
                                       (6, 10, 12 at d = 5, 7, 9)

That resolves an apparent conflict in the fieldnote: its Result 3 reports
distance preserved only at pitch >= pitch_min(d), which exceeds d - 1, yet the
published rows = 2 packing sits at d - 1 with full distance. Result 3 measured
at rows = 4. Two bands can pack tighter than three or more can.

Run `python3 multiband.py` for the self-test against the published builder.
